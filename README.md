## 💡 Philosophy

> "Automation is not about replacing people; it's about freeing them to do more meaningful work."

I believe in:
- **Automation First:** Eliminate manual processes
- **Security by Default:** Security integrated into every layer
- **Scalability:** Design for growth from day one
- **Reliability:** Build systems that fail gracefully
- **Documentation:** Code and infrastructure should be self-documenting
